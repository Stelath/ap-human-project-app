It was first declared a national dish by General Phibunsongkhram who helped overthrow Thailand's monarchy. The dish was initially intended to help unify the country by creating a dish that was purly Thai. Although, Phibunsongkhram also hoped that it would improve the diet of people who ate only rice. There is, however, a slight detail, Pad Thai is not originally Thai. In fact, it has Chinese roots and the first part of its full name kway teow phat Thai translates to rice noodles in Chinese. and although it is unknown in how it reached Thailand it is most likely that it was introduced through immigration.")

Tom Yum is a shrimp soup with chillies, cilantro, lemongrass, and mushrooms. Tom Yum’s history is unknown currently however many people believe that Tom Yum was most likely created because of a surplus of freshwater shrimp and the herbs were later added to get rid of the fishy flavor in the broth.")

The dish includes papayas, tomatoes, chilies, and optionally dried shrimp. Although it is popular all throughout south asia in Thailand it is still considered street food and is not served as much in restaurants.
